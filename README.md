# FacialRecognitionSystem_deployable
Easy to use, deployable facial recognition system.

Connect a ip camera to the local network, configure or find out its ip address.
Enter it in the CLI menu and then you are ready to go.
An async and multi device connect system is being developed by me. Stay tuned for it.
